To whom it may concern,

My name is Esha Gourikrishna and I highly recommend Louis Labuzienski.
In the two years I have known Louis, have been greatly inspired by his work ethic, passion, and positive spirit, all of which are present in his professional life. Louis is responsible and makes his voice heard when need be. As a coworker of his, I have seen how his ability to vocalize the need for change in an organization has created positive outcomes for all. Personally, it has inspired me to be more outspoken for positive change. 
Louis is a top performer, especially when he integrates a cause he cares about with his work. In his choice of internships, I have admired how he implements his passion for social issues in the work he does. It is evident that Louis will exceed expectations in an environment that aligns with his values. 
Louis is always willing to offer his assistance and is excellent at establishing relationships with his team. He would be an asset to any organization.
