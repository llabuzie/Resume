Louie is one of the most genuinely kind and intelligent people that I have ever had the chance to meet. Throughout high school, he was always the person who would do whatever he could to make sure others around him were comfortable and enjoying themselves. He has never shied away from calling others out if they are doing or saying something to hurt someone else, and does his best to always ensure that the people around him are happy. His sense of humor makes him a joy to be around, as he is able to make everyone laugh without putting those around him down. Louie has always been a hard worker, making sure to take time to complete whatever project he is working on with care and precision, regardless of whether it is a school or personal project. His ability to work with others in a way that highlights both his and his other group member's strengths has always stood out to me, and he one of the best teammates someone could ask for. Louie Labuzienski has made a long lasting impact on my life, and is someone that I am proud to call my friend.
